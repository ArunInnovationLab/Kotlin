* Object - is an instance of a class
* Methods - functions defined inside a class tahat define the behaviour of object
* Inheritance - Creating a new class which is derivative of an existing one
* Polymorphism - The ability of a function to change its behaviour when called by different objects. Example : "+" operator, interfaces
* Encapsulation - Combining data members and member methods in a single unit. Limits access to methods and variables by encasing them in a single unit of scope
* Abstraction - Ability to hide implementation details for data security
